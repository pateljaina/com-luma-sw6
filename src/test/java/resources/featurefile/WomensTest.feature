  Scenario: Verify if I can sort the products by name using the filter
    When I select the filter to sort by "Product Name"
    Then I should see the products name display in alphabetical order

@Sanity @Regression
  Scenario: Verify if I can sort the products by price using the filter
    When I select the filter to sort by "Price"
    Then I should see the products price display in ascending order
